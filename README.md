This repo contains the necessary python notebook code files for the analysis completed for Assessment 2 of the Machine Learning Module for the MSC Data Science and Statistics degree at the University of Leeds

This project explores the use of machine learning techniques to predict NHL player induction into the Hockey Hall of Fame based on historical career data. Using a supervised learning approach (Random Forest) and a semi-supervised alternative (Label Spreading), the study evaluates model performance, generalization, and practical trade-offs in the context of sports analytics.

The topic was selected during the 2025 Stanley Cup Finals, coinciding with increased public discussion around player legacies. As an Edmonton Oilers fan, this context provided timely motivation to explore how career trajectories align with Hall of Fame outcomes from a data-driven perspective.

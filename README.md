This repo contains the necessary python notebook code files for the analysis completed for Assessment 2 of the Machine Learning Module for the MSC Data Science and Statistics degree at the University of Leeds

This project aims to recognize typed letters surrounded by ellipses in images. To achieve this, the dataset was processed by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, effectively retaining key features while minimizing computational complexity. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) was optimized through a grid search, revealing that the linear kernel demonstrated superior generalization capabilities compared to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
